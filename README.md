## Ericsson Foresight Machine Learning Hackathon'19

This challenge was hosted by Ericsson India for ML and was hosted on `Hackerearth` platform.

Number of questions : 2

### Problem-1:
**Problem statement**

Your tasking is to predict the overall rating of reviews.     

**Evaluation metric**

F1-Score

**Baseline**

LogisticRegression: 40-50% on the test set

**Task**
You are provided with the reviews that the users have submitted for a company and a few intricate scores. Your task is to predict the overall rating provided by the reviewer.   

### Problem-2:
We are living in a digital world where people prefer to read articles online or watch videos rather than reading a book. Assume that you are a member of a marketing agency and you are given a dataset having the title, subjects, and other features based on which you have to predict what will be the material of to-be-published research so that you can tie-up with an ideal publisher and help them grow. The following are the material types:

Book

Sound disc

Videocassette

Sound cassette

Music

Mixed

CR

**Task**: You have to predict the column “MaterialType” and submit in the format given in the “sample_submissions.csv” file. Also, note that evaluation criteria will be the weighted f1-score.

**Evaluation metrics**: F1-Score
